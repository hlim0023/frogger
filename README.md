# frogger
A frogger game project

The key of the project is implementing it in Functional Programming.

This project uses classes and functions from Observables rx.js and uses svg elements to add visual effects, animate them, and make them interactive.
The entire project uses typescript to implement currying as a lambda function, and also makes extensive use of pure functions and FRP methods.
